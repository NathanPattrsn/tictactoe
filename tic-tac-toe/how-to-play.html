                <h2 id="gsh2">Game Setup</h2>
                <p id="gsp">Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns placing their symbol, either an "X" or an "O", on an empty space on the grid.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="gameplay">
                <h2 id="gph2">Gameplay</h2>
                <p id="gpp">On each turn, a player must place their symbol on an empty space on the grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins the game. If all of the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie. You can reset the board by clicking the "Reset" button and to reset the scoreboard you can click "Reset Scoreboard" button.</p>

                <p id="sp">To win at Tic Tac Toe, you must try to block your opponent's attempts to get three in a row while also setting up opportunities for yourself. It is important to pay attention to what your opponent is doing and try to anticipate their next move.</p>
